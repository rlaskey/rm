Keep the humans. Ditch the robots.

## What is this?

A starter kit to create your own platform.

## Base requirements / costs

Get a domain name. `.name` is $9.98/year at Namecheap, as of 2025-10.

Next, get hosting. Linode has a Nanode for $7/month, which is $5/month for the
smallest shared CPU service + $2/month for backups.

Experience and/or patience is required.
